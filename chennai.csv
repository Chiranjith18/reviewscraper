"5","chennai","The Madras Taproom","Had ordered Honey Chilli Lotus Stem and an hour had passed by but still the order was not received, upon asking they kept saying the order will be here in 2 minutes. Never faced any issue here in my previous visits but this time it was awful. The waiters were not responding well and in the end even though we had not received our order it was still charged in the bill. Very much disappointed with the service provided."

"7","chennai","SOS - Same Old Story","I was really disappointed with my visit to this bar. I ordered cocktails expecting the ingredients listed on the menu, but what I got was completely different. Instead of the quality spirits advertised, they used much cheaper alcohol without saying anything. It feels dishonest and left me feeling cheated. If you care about what’s in your drink, be cautious—what’s written on the menu isn’t what you actually get. I’d strongly suggest double-checking before ordering cocktails here."
"8","chennai","SOS - Same Old Story","worst place to go
they don't have enough seats and we were two people and they just took a table and kept it near the door .
so worst experience"
"9","chennai","SOS - Same Old Story","? 1 Star Review: Extremely Unprofessional & Disrespectful Staff – Avoid at All Costs

Absolutely disgusted with the behavior at this establishment. After settling our bill in full, we were shocked to be treatedg with such disrespect by the staff — especially the manager and team, who acted with no sense of professionalism or accountability.

To make matters worse, once the police arrived around 10pm , the staff began treating us as if we were criminals. It was humiliating and completely uncalled for. There was no justification for such behavior, and the situation was handled in the worst possible way.

It’s clear that the management lacks proper training in hospitality and crisis...read more"
"10","chennai","SOS - Same Old Story","Highly disappointed... Poor quality of food... Expensive for no reason... Please avoid"
"11","chennai","The Summer House Eatery","The Summer House Eatery is impressive - the ambience, vibe and the food is all pleasant. The staff is attentive and friendly, yet the whole staff should be well-versed with the menu.

Parmesan Garlic Fries ? is the delightful snack while awaiting the rest of the order. Chicken Gyoza is a kid friendly starter ? The Chicken Club Sandwich is padded with grilled chicken breast, egg and nourishing vegetables . A perfect coffee companion ! Nasi Goreng is a rice bowl stirred through with bell peppers, served along mini chicken skewers. A hearty main meal! The signature sips is average.

The eatery has a fine menu for coffee and tea."
"12","chennai","The Summer House Eatery","Food is tasty but gave us discomfort in the stomach right after we left the place. Our stomach got so upset. There are many good cafes in Chennai don’t waste time and money on this . Worst experience ever"
"13","chennai","The Summer House Eatery","The food was good but the service was next level! We ate the summer salad, buttered mushrooms, thai green curry and char kway teow- one of the best salads I’ve ever had - the rest was good but not amazing…

The service was genuinely next level! Their team went out of their way to ensure a positive dining experience for us! Mr. Saravanan- the manager was particularly helpful with tips on what’s good- special kudos to him."
"14","chennai","The Summer House Eatery","Wild mushroom & cappuccino soup is a top notch?? had 6 types of food. All are excellent, tasty & a Lovely presentation?
Made my day.. excited?"

"17","chennai","Noci Restobar","Good ambience and awesome food everything looked and tasted really well.. Mr Harish was the one with the service and he really did a great job ??"
"18","chennai","Noci Restobar","Awesome food and service good work. Mr harish’s service was good."
"19","chennai","Noci Restobar","Located right in the center of Chennai inside Express Avenue Mall, Noci Resto Bar is the perfect place for a relaxing and tasty lunch. The food is absolutely fantastic – fresh, flavorful, and well-presented. Whether you're craving Indian classics or something continental, the menu has great variety.

The service is top-notch. The staff are friendly, quick, and make sure you have a great experience every time.

With its stylish ambience and central location, Noci is ideal for office-goers, shoppers, and foodies looking for quality and comfort during lunchtime.

Definitely a must-visit lunch destination in Chennai!"
"20","chennai","Khaas - The Elevated Indian Kitchen & Bar","It was a wonderful experience

Really like the service

Special mention to Mr Jack"
"21","chennai","Khaas - The Elevated Indian Kitchen & Bar","Refused to accept District app booking. Please don't book through the app"
"22","chennai","Khaas - The Elevated Indian Kitchen & Bar","Really disappointing experience. Prawns were rubbery, fish barely cooked through. Food tasted off, like something was just thrown together. The server kept insisting on dishes we clearly didn’t want and kept pushing, almost forcing the order. And of course, those turned out to be the worst ones on the table.

When we mentioned we didn’t like the food, he just vanished,no apology, no check-in, nothing. Felt like we were left to deal with a bad meal and worse service.

Definitely not a place I’d recommend."
"23","chennai","Khaas - The Elevated Indian Kitchen & Bar","khaas really made my day khaas with the food they served. Ambience, food n service was perfect."

"27","chennai","Lord of the Drinks","they denied Stag entry even in week days. not wasting my money"
"28","chennai","Lord of the Drinks","Ambience is pleasant and suits the mindset. Special mention to the Stewart Aravind for kind service throughout the visit."
"29","chennai","Lord of the Drinks","I wouldn’t complain about the overpriced food or the boring drinks - LOTD’s terrible food and drinks are well documented.

But the staff at the Nungambakkam outlet were exceptionally rude, did not inform us about their offer/discount policies beforehand, and then decided to pick a fight about it when we paid the bill.

Terrible establishment, especially if you’re looking for a place for events/parties for larger groups. Please steer clear of this one - over a dozen better places within a 1 km radius!"
"30","chennai","The Great Kabab Factory - Radisson Blu","Been a regular for a long time now. Ms Kusum was really great at taking care of us."

"32","chennai","The Great Kabab Factory - Radisson Blu","Food was extremely good. Sahir, Pooja and Kusum’s hospitality was awesome.."
"33","chennai","The Great Kabab Factory - Radisson Blu","5-Star Review:

Had an incredible dining experience at The Great Kebab Factory, Radisson Blu Chennai for my wife’s birthday celebration! The food was absolutely amazing—every starter was delicious, and the Galouti Kebab is a must-try. It’s also the only buffet in Chennai where I’ve had such an amazing Biryani. The desserts were equally delightful.

A special mention to Master Chef Ghanim, who went above and beyond. Despite my late request at 3 PM, he personally made a special cake for my wife, which was a truly kind and memorable gesture.

Highly recommend this place for an exceptional food experience and top-notch hospitality! ?????"
"34","chennai","The Great Kabab Factory - Radisson Blu","It’s not actually Buffet. They have set menu at fixed rate and serving everything on table. Not at all enjoyable. Food quality; a big question mark. First time in my life after having food in restaurant I got my stomach upset. Even my wife complaining about cramp in stomach."
"35","chennai","Oasis - Radisson Blu","Food was good. Service was really great. Samir, the waiter was very helpful."
"36","chennai","Oasis - Radisson Blu","We went for breakfast Food was good."
"37","chennai","Oasis - Radisson Blu","Premium dining was felt only in the price of the food items. Service was very poor. Even the basic services were not done properly. Starting from the initial table arrangement, taking order, serving water/starter - we had to ask/wait for everything."
"38","chennai","Oasis - Radisson Blu","Food was good but it took forever ever to arrive. The waiting time is longer than expected"

"40","chennai","Oasis - Radisson Blu","wow! very sad to see an international Hotel having very poor hygienic factor, if u can see in image where the onions bowl is you can find a small cockroach .... This shocked me!! paying a premium price for the food and the least I expect this bug on the plate. I hope not to go here again.....!!!"
"41","chennai","Locofeast","The menu updated in the app is an old one and the rates have increased significantly for all the dishes now... Further the quality of the food was also not good nowadays..."
"42","chennai","Locofeast","very good experience . my child enjoy a lot"
"43","chennai","Locofeast","Good idea but service should be fast"
"44","chennai","Locofeast","Visited some time ago with a couple of friends, good ambience and vibe but food was quite average, hope they work on that!"

"46","chennai","Thulsi","Food was very good ESP the rasam vadai .Had a wonderful time with friends and thanks to Armaan who served is to perfection and put up with our craziness."
"47","chennai","Thulsi","Thulsi is a wonderful spot in Chennai that truly stands out. The food is delicious, well-prepared, and served with great attention to detail. Every dish feels thoughtfully crafted, making it a treat for the taste buds.

The ambience is equally impressive — warm, inviting, and perfect whether you’re dining with family, friends, or colleagues. The interiors strike the right balance between elegance and comfort, creating a relaxed atmosphere that enhances the dining experience.

Overall, Thulsi delivers both in taste and setting. Definitely a place worth visiting if you’re looking for good food paired with an excellent ambience in Chennai."
"48","chennai","Thulsi","Food was super bad … not worth it"
"49","chennai","Thulsi","Do not book a table here. They have no sense of timing or honoring reservations. Made a reservation for 1:30PM, showed up at 1:30PM, only to find out my reservation was not noted. Was asked to wait for 5 minutes. Kept waiting, 30 minutes went by. Restaurant's response whenever was asked was ""5-10min, tables are being cleaned."" Waited for 45 minutes with no signs of getting a table anytime soon. Had parents who are diabetic and had taken tablets, only to not get food.

Callous attitude. The manager or whoever it was at the front desk cooly says, ""All tables are running full."" Why would I care if all tables are full? I made a reservation, and you failed to note it down...read more"
"50","chennai","Thulsi","Reservation was made through Zomato for 3 at 1.30 pm, on 20th July 2025. Reservation was not found in their register. Only when showed the booking reference, they accepted. We were made to wait till 2.10 without a table being provided and everytime we asked the supervisor in charge, she simply kept on saying 5 more minutes. She never came and told us to wait. Only when we ask her, she kept saying 5 more minutes.
our first experience was worst, without having any food.
We were not the only family waiting for table, more than 4-5 more groups waiting for table, after making reservations.
My rating for this restaurant is ZERO"
"51","chennai","Pa Pa Ya","Pa Pa Ya should be more like Pa Pa Nah.
We went on a night when the restaurant wasn’t even very busy and still got the worst service I’ve seen anywhere in Chennai. Had to wait to get our table which we had reserved. Then, everything we ordered took at least 30 mins, and no water so served to us for quite some time despite asking. We were hopeful the food would make up for the sloppy service.
But, the food was by all standards below average, with the exception of their salmon cream cheese sushi. The dimsums were meh, the edamame open bao was a Hariyani Kabab in a bao rebranded to sound cooler. Never returning, do not recommend!"
"52","chennai","Pa Pa Ya","Great place, lovely food. Super friendly and patient staff! Would advice you call and reserve a table before you get there. Vernon looked after us, very professional and polite!"
"53","chennai","Pa Pa Ya","The service was absolutely horrendous. We had taken the outdoor seating to enjoy the breeze and city view. Unfortunately, it turned out to be such a terrible experience which ruined our evening. There were no staffs to tend to the outdoor tables. We had to wait nearly 20 minutes to even get the staff from indoors to pay attention to us, come outside and take our order. After requesting for the bill, we waited for nearly 15 minutes before getting up from our tables to walk to the indoors and request the cashier to generate the bill for our tables, ourselves. This is not the kind of service a fine-dining restaurant which charges such a hefty amount for food, is supposed to provide. Never...read more"
"54","chennai","Pa Pa Ya","Good customer service and fantastic food taste."
"55","chennai","Pa Pa Ya","Food was ordinary. Not really delectable. Certain food items can be improved. Portion needs to be improved.
One of the staffs behaviour was not welcoming"
"56","chennai","Lexxus","service is too good"
"57","chennai","Garrison","worst in every aspect must be thrown from zomato listing they don't accept zomato payments due to offers I don't know why this hotel is being listed despite they don't have respect for it and ridiculous response from both platform and restaurant end"
"58","chennai","Garrison","I must say the place took me by surprise especially with the food & service.
I personally complimented the chef for the Hara bara kebab as it was very unique and it just melted in your mouth.
The service was quick and Mr.Girish made sure we were comfortable. The chef Mr.Mani does have magic in his hands.
I'd definitely recommend this place to anybody wanting to have a great time and good food."

"60","chennai","Garrison","Comfy place. Neat ambience. Awesome food.
One of the best Crispy Beef i have tasted till now. Crispy means crispy it was to that level. If you are beef lover then must try place this is. Don't miss it.
Prawn dry roast was another extraordinary dish.
Cream of chicken soup was very good. Perfect blend.
We thought of trying some dessert but tummy was already full bcos of the evening Briyani ?
Should visit again soon."
"61","chennai","Garrison","Amazing ambience and awesome food . The overall look and feel of the restaurant is very good and modern . The food is also tasty and good variety .

"63","chennai","Haunted","Worst buffet in the world

They will serve you one year old gulaab jamoon prepared and kept in the fridge for one year like in the lab all frogs are kept in the formalin inside the bottle

all items are Worst"
"64","chennai","Haunted","I ordered a chicken dish and was shocked to find crab legs in it. Totally unacceptable and disgusting. When I raised the issue, the manager refused to apologise and no staff member took any responsibility. We were seated in a cramped, uncomfortable room, and the washrooms were dirty and smelled terrible. The glowing reviews online are clearly misleading. This place is a big letdown—I won’t be coming back."

"73","chennai","Cocomaya","Ambience was relaxing, service was quick and the Nutella Brownie hit the sweet spot"
"74","chennai","The Big Barbeque","Worst and waste of money. Don’t even think of going here. Pathetic service. Spilled other’s food waste on us while waiting. Spilled the welcome drink through us entire saree got spoiled.
Poor and poorest service basically there’s no manpower to address people.

Pathetic food particularly starters were cold and dry. No variety of main dishes and taste is horrible. The same curse continues for desserts too.

Never ever consider of visiting here."
"75","chennai","The Big Barbeque","I recently visited this place it was horrible and food was bad and they did not wash the meat properly blood stains were there and when we complained they did not care. no proper Staffing to manage the crowd on weekends. it was horrible experience."
