"23","Trichy","Thamboora Restaurant","The place takes longer than average to bring the dishes to table.
The quantity is pretty low for the price point. And the quality doesn't justify the price either.
Simply put, overpriced.

It's a little densely packed place, But the seating is comfortable."

"31","Trichy","Ammikal Restaurant","the place is clean, sadly that's the only thing good about the place. the food is average, the service staff are rude and not patient enough to take ur order correct.

coming to the food part l,

for a bill or 2400

we got 4 mediocre mutton biryani and 1 chicken biryani

veg meal was ok ok not great very few basic items nothing great about them.

now the non veg meal, ul get the same veg meal don't expect any non veg on ur plate it's only one fish gravy without the pieces and no papad and sweet apparently non veg meal does not have them.

This place does not have half the items on the menu and no one there can care less about it. it's your fault for ordering things off the menu."

"52","Trichy","Cascade Cafe","We had gone as group on a weekday afternoon so the place was empty. We occupied the outside seating area which has a nice view of the garden. They have done up the place well with plants. All the food we ordered was good, of special mention the pasta arabbiata and potato fries. The problem here is there’s only one person taking the order so after a while when people started trickling in, the food was coming in very slowly. Overall a nice cafe in Trichy"
