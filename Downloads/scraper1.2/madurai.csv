"4","Madurai","Barbeque Nation","A decent barbecue place in madurai i would say, but the spread was less compared to the chennai and Bangalore outlets. Staff are very courteous and polite, service was quick. Need a lot of improvement on the live counters i would say.
Nevertheless a decent place to hangout with friends and family."

"9","Madurai","Amsavalli Bhavan","Not at all worthy of a visit or mention.. tried biryani.. nothing great .. my mom had hyped this so much from when she ate 33 years back.. I’m sad I wasted months dreaming about eating this on my trip"
"10","Madurai","Amsavalli Bhavan","Worst place overhyped by food reviewers and locals. The server will insist on serving the slow moving item after checking with the kitchen. The interior decor is from 80's bar but will still have the same dust and cobwebs."

"30","Madurai","Annapoorna Mithai","Awesome food. The quality and taste are soo goood. This is one of the finest North Indian restaurant at Madurai. I always visit this restaurant at least once in 15 days because of their food, sweets and service. Very kind employees. Kudos. ??

Annapoorna should open their branches across Madurai."
"31","Madurai","A2B - Adyar Ananda Bhavan","Third class service, if possible I would have given minus stars. Being from another city, I went there 2 elderly ladies knowing their name.

Waiters were not ready to serve the table despite managers urge. Finally we had leave the place after half an hour of waiting without even been asked for order. Whole other tables were served.

Too much of success have spoiled their attitude."

"33","Madurai","Modern Restaurant","A regular customer since 1990s. best place for a wholesome veg meal!"
"34","Madurai","Modern Restaurant","If you like the taste of the food in the restaurant, then better order in zomato and eat. This is because if you go there lto eat, then they won't treat you well. They just take the sambar, chutney which were kept and used by the customers in the neighboring table and then force you to have it. You have to ask multiple times and wait for a long time for the waiter to replace with fresh ones for you. And, after doing all these, they will nag you for tips.
If you think of going there and getting parcel, then the packaging won't be the same as you get while ordering online and you have to wait for a long time."
"35","Madurai","Modern Restaurant","?????? ???? ?????????"

"37","Madurai","Modern Restaurant","Worst experience I could ever imagine. The staff (laxman) was so rude that they literally told us no food available for us. The manager managing counter did nothing about it. No action was taken, we had to leave restaurant outrageously.
A BIG NO to any non Tamilian especially north Indian."
"38","Madurai","Mug & Beans","Food was good. Pramit helped me with good reccos!"
"39","Madurai","Mug & Beans","I ordered 4 items not enough for 3 member all are in small quantity but taste wise its good"
"40","Madurai","Mug & Beans","Good place in the nearest vicinity but indoor seating isn't available, service is surprisingly slow need to improve on that.
Peri peri fries: 5/5
Iced coffee: 2/5
Chilli cheese toast: 3/5"
"41","Madurai","Mug & Beans","Presentation was so good. It has wide variety of must try dishes like fried icecream, french fries and fried momos.

Pizza and pasta were not up to the mark. Instagrammable place in and around Madurai.

I would recommend people to try milkshakes when visiting this place."
"42","Madurai","The Banyan Resturant","I was here yesterday with the extended family to celebrate my dad's birthday. Senthil and Sasi from the Heritage team took care of us. the entire crew was very supportive. Food chpices and Ambience was of a very high standard."
"43","Madurai","The Banyan Resturant","Every order takes 30 minutes. Even if it’s lime water or coconut water. They didn’t have à la carté when we arrived. Also coconut water was stale and took 40 mins. Buffet was the only saving grace. But not to save the overall experience."

"45","Madurai","The Banyan Resturant","The two days we stayed at this beautiful property, we got to sample their daily spread of fabulous buffet breakfast at The Banyan, that has both indoor & outdoor seating while the spread’s all inside. The food was no doubt fabulous but it was the service that amplified the whole experience. Day 1 we had the vegetarian selections from Southern & Northern India, be it the unique idlis, the poori subzi, the fresh hot ghee roasts from the live counter, everything was just perfect. With all those chutneys the dosa and idli was wonderful. Especially the Kara chutney that was spicy and tangy, just the right bit. The coconut chutney could have been a little more fresher, but overall...read more"
"46","Madurai","The Banyan Resturant","We happened to be in the hotel for dinner last weekend. While the main course was decent, it was the dessert section which made me write this review. 2 of the dishes were spoiled and we immediately mentioned it to the waiters. The fun part was instead of verifying and clearing the menu from the buffet, the waiter started questioning our whereabouts. He was more curious to understand if we were locals or tourists. We even called the manager and informed as there were over 10 families with kids in the restaurant at that point in time. But no one came over to remove the dish not did they acknowledge the feedback. Such worst service and food in reputed restaurants are really concerning. Not...read more"
"47","Madurai","Krishnan Mess","Today i went to krishnan mess in kamarajar street. We ordered biriyani and tandoori chicken. We waited for 1 hour after that they told the dish is not available and asked to order some other item. They have returned my money and their service is worst. Please dont visit the restaurant if you want a good service. Worst experience"

"49","Madurai","Krishnan Mess","It was a surprise visit to this place for dinner takeaway. We ordered a proper four course meal for four people and still the bill was under five hundred rupees. Even a road side restaurant would charge this much but for the quantity and quality of the food that they give, the pricing was phenomenal.
We started with Mutton Paya Soup. It’s not at all like typical Paya. It’s a soup with Mutton legs, which tasted divine. As it was a parcel, the quantity was huge. Easily four of us could have a small cup full of soup. It was a steal for Rs. 40. Chicken Lollypop was the only pricy item. Rs. 140 for just three pieces were too much and didn’t taste that great too. The size of Parotta was...read more"

"52","Madurai","Temple City - Family Veg Restaurant","Usually bus stand nearby restaurant loots you for unhygienic and no taste food as travellers would just eat in haste and leaves to catch their buses according to their destination, but honestly speaking there was no quality compromised even in single dish from what we have ordered,
Ordered idly, kaara paniyaram, plantain bonda, paruppu vadai, Aapam with coconut milk and 2 varieties of veg kurma and finally pepper idly.
1. Idly was served as they say jasmine soft like in Madurai accompanied by coconut chutney, pudina chutney, kaara chutney and sambhar.
2. Kaara paniyaram was served with coconut chutney which was delicious.
3. Plantain bonda was good in taste but not hot though.

"57","Madurai","Hotel New Sri Sabareesh","We went with family and even after sitting for 5 mins, nobody was ready to take order. When we called one sever, he came with an uninterested, lethargic attitude and not ready to take order and by seeing his worst service we stood up and went away. But nobody bothered because people are ready to wait and eat here, so they are not concerned a bout few people like us. Very worst service and irresponsible management."
"58","Madurai","Hotel New Sri Sabareesh","I visited madurai with my brother and went here for breakfast after temple visit. Overall it's a good place. I started with idly & later had poori bhaji.. one plate has two idlys and they are accompanied with three different chutneys & sambar.. drool worthy for sure. My brother had rocket dosa and that also has three different chutneys with sambar. Tasted good. Ended with coffee. Overall a very good coffee and loved it. The only thing that i didn't like was that the person serving us was an old man and he didn't like going back n forth to the kitchen to get stuffs. That was not of a turn off . Surely worth a visit."
