3,Coimbatore,Barbeque Nation,Vikram Senthil S
4,Coimbatore,Barbeque Nation,"They cancelled our billing on easy-diner just because they did not want to pass the discount and gave us some stupid reason online link not working. The food overall is terrible. Few things were good , one dish per course."
5,Coimbatore,Barbeque Nation,Customer service was excellent. Delicious food and nice ambience. Biswanath was our service person. Excellent patient service done by him.
6,Coimbatore,Bulls & Bears Bistro,"I don't know what Harshita saw in this place, her review was misleading. Suresh was disappointed. Desserts were amazing. Lasagna was not. Burgers were filling. Reasonable price. Must try."
7,Coimbatore,Bulls & Bears Bistro,Lamb shanks were top notch.
8,Coimbatore,Bulls & Bears Bistro,"The beverages and the food, both were very good. We sat to work out of here for a few hours and I would say it was a good decision, we were comfortable throughout. We had a cold brew and a Biscoff cold coffee, both were good. In short the quality of the coffee is great and the staff are very courteous as well!!"
9,Coimbatore,Bulls & Bears Bistro,Great food! Lotus Biscoff Milkshake was too good...Must try!
10,Coimbatore,The Edition - Library Bar - The Residency Hotel,One of the most expensive bar in City..a beer cost is 900 ..they charge 5% Service charge 14.5% VAT plus 18% GST all together a whooping cost for a beer Rs 900.. Going to food side they provide only Chinese sides and cant keep it in mouth worthless taste and there is no Indian sides in this bar..This bar is only running for foreigners in dollars
11,Coimbatore,The Edition - Library Bar - The Residency Hotel,"I am surprised this place has 4.4 stars!

There are 5 options in veg. Similar issue with nin veg as well.
The cottage cheese is the worst I have had in my lifetime.
Who even cooks a sweet dish in a bar as a starter?
If paneer is sweet, I can only imagine how the other dishes would fare.

I asked for some spicy sauce, I got a Schezwan sauce.
To my surprise there is no spice whatsoever in that either
My wife gulpled it like it's her regular del Monte ketchup and she has 0 tolerance for spice.

The management needs to look at what the hell is wrong with the chef! Utter disappointment.

Beer options are limited as well.

All hype and no quality.

P.S. atleast the complimentary peanuts could...read more"
12,Coimbatore,The Edition - Library Bar - The Residency Hotel,"I really liked the place so much. Good service, tasty yummy food and the drinks were awesome too. Must visit"
13,Coimbatore,Bread Korner,"Not accepted payments from Zomato. Bluntly refused. If not accepting, shd Not come under offer zone"
14,Coimbatore,Bread Korner,This has been a favorite hangout spot from my tuition days ... Now even after 4 years the taste is still the same and well maintained ... Burgers and pizzas are the ones most recommended .. Cheers to Gowtham for his hardwork ..
15,Coimbatore,Bread Korner,Navpreet Kaur Oberoi
16,Coimbatore,Bread Korner,Awsm shawarma...best shawarma in South India...loved chicken sandwich... delicious taste from the first bite. Do try the food here. You cant resist to be back here again.??
17,Coimbatore,CakeBee,"Hard to digest price for this low quantity. Especially on plum cake the pic I uploaded size is too small.
Thanks"
18,Coimbatore,CakeBee,Their pink color macaron was good but their green also okay but their yellow colour macaron was worst taste
19,Coimbatore,Sri Krishna Sweets,DOUGLAZ EDWARD CULAS
20,Coimbatore,Sri Krishna Sweets,Sweets are good. Rate is higher. Quality is good. Famous for musorpa. Milk sweets rate are high. The taste will be good. Savories also tasted great
21,Coimbatore,Sri Krishna Sweets,Never had a negative experience with Sri Krishna Sweets. Always keeps the quality to the highest of what they can. Really superb. Better than other rivalries in Coimbatore.
22,Coimbatore,The Living Room,they could easily handled the matter of not considering two males as couple with dignity but they lied to district by saying they cancelled because they were full . that is the exact reason which pissed me off.. if you are trying to be an open minded classy place in Coimbatore at least train your people to handle issues with mindfulness and no one will get pissed even if you want only certain type of people in your restaurant
23,Coimbatore,The Living Room,So we phoned in to book a table for 2. And they straight away rejected stating they dont let stags. lol. I was visiting Coimbatore and wanted to catch up with a friend for brunch. Ive seen places charging a cover fee which is redeemed later but this was a straight rejection. No wonder ppl hate clubs and pubs in Coimbatore. Such a shame and to ppl who want to book a slot on Zomato. Do not waste your money.
24,Coimbatore,The Living Room,"Great experience overall! The ambience was lovely, the food was awesome and the place was clean and well-maintained. Hospitality at its best.

When I visited, it started raining  but the staff quickly informed customers and efficiently shifted tables from the open area to accommodate everyone inside. Their prompt action and care truly stood out.

Valet parking is available, and they offer good vegetarian options too. Definitely a must-try spot!"
25,Coimbatore,The Living Room,"Very Good service from Mr.Saravanan
Orders were in time ???"
26,Coimbatore,The Living Room,"The food is extremely spicy and greasy.. we couldnt eat anything properly cos of the spice level.. whom are they catering for? Themselves? they should at least ask what spice level u take.. the only thing good was the soup, rest was just an infusion of spices.. not recommended"
27,Coimbatore,Valarmathi Kongunaatu Samayal,"Had to wait 30-45 mins at 9 pm to get inside. The line was huge even for getting a seat of 2 so I thought that the food would be off the charts. Boy, was I so wrong! The chicken biriyani, I couldn't finish it because the meat tasted fishy (a huge problem outside WB I have seen- especially in Southern States. I mean I come from a coastal state too and our chicken tastes like plain chicken and fish like fish. Why should either taste like the other? Keep it clean, make it clean). The kothu parotta was average at best and the only great find was onion podi uthappam."
28,Coimbatore,Valarmathi Kongunaatu Samayal,"One of the best restaurants in coimbatore for local cuisine. visited this place after seeing some positive reviews. we ordered parota, Mutton chukka, Chicken Pallipalayam, Mutton kheema ball and Mutton biriyani, the food was exceptionally good except for Mutton chukka, which was ok. Super fast service and food is reasonably priced."
29,Coimbatore,Valarmathi Kongunaatu Samayal,"today nattu Koli varuval was very bad experience to me, it's not boiled, i through it, very very sad day to me,"
30,Coimbatore,Valarmathi Kongunaatu Samayal,Visited this place for the first time. ordered mutton biryani and parotta. loved the taste. worth the hype and price. Service was very quick.must visit place
31,Coimbatore,Famous Biryani House,"Taste and quality of food is top notch.
The people are very courteous and will suggest you their fast moving and bestsellers.
More than the food I liked the freshly made salad/raitha.
The food was really good and was really worth the money. Will recommend this place to my friends and family?"
32,Coimbatore,Famous Biryani House,One of the best place for fast biriyani. Sankarankoil Mutton Biriyani is an dish to taste out there!
33,Coimbatore,Mufasa,"over hyped food is below average ,but not given what we expect"
34,Coimbatore,Mufasa,The food was excellent and the ambience was really good. godwin very polite service and so friendly thanks to mufasa
35,Coimbatore,Mufasa,food and service was excellent siva service was excellent and tnx for suggesting menu and drink. thank to mufasa
36,Coimbatore,Mufasa,Excellent food and service by elaya kumar he is very polite and friendly thanks to mufasa
37,Coimbatore,Mufasa,The service was excellent given by cartwheen podi idly and the cocktail parotta was excellent.. thanks to mufasa
38,Coimbatore,Chin Chin - The Residency Hotel,"RECEIVED THE WORST SERVICE EVER POSSIBLE BY A RESTAURANT at Chin Chin, Coimbatore


Chin Chin has been a regular place for us since so many years. However in the recent visits, the service and quality has degraded, but was at least acceptable, until today.

We had a group booking today for an occasion. Since we were a group, to make things simpler, we ordered most of the dishes a few days in advance itself, through the manager. So we ordered only a very few additional dishes on the day.

Few of the starters were served, and then they brought the main course. When we asked what happened to the remaining starters which were ordered previously itself, the waiter, Mr. Vinod, claimed...read more"
39,Coimbatore,Chin Chin - The Residency Hotel,"Went there Thursday night with my office team. To my surprise the place was bustling with people. Service was decent. However, to describe the food quality i have no other word than ""horrible"". The meat tasted weird, like it was stale. Every single dish was deep fried, in I don't know which kinda oil, so it made your throat hurt. Most of the ordered dishes tasted similar. In today's times, the menu, chef and recipes all require an urgent upgrade."
40,Coimbatore,Chin Chin - The Residency Hotel,Anish Mathew Samuel
41,Coimbatore,Chin Chin - The Residency Hotel,"Wonderful lunch at Chin Chin great hospitality great food lovely service nice and clean and neat all was good except the Tom yum prawn soup it was a disaster but everything else was divine great work Team Chin Chin & Residency very nice front office staff Jeeva who remembered us from our previous visit thank you ?

Chef Anish Samuel"
42,Coimbatore,Chin Chin - The Residency Hotel,Dined at Chin Chin after 6 years and the place looks great... good job with the redecoration! The food has always been delicious and the taste has only gotten better... the dimsums and lamb are a must try... don't forget to get their amazing cocktails too... the staff and their service was absolutely fantastic... can't wait to dine again with them....
43,Coimbatore,The Cavern @312,"The food and ambience is good but the service is a disappointment. We had to constantly turn around our heads looking for staff and making an eye contact/signalling them in order to ask for anything. For the first five minutes, there was noone coming to our table, and this continued till the end till we received the bill and paid it. I feel that the place isn't adequately staffed or the staff need to be trained to balance all the tables alike. I hope they improve."
44,Coimbatore,Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar,i purchased 1 swissroll strawberry chocolate for my daughter. it was a take away. once we reached home and ate it we were surprised to know that it was stale. it didn't have any smell but the taste was so bad that we had to spit out and throw everything in dustbin. I didn't feed that to my daughter anymore. please dont keep such stale products on the counter and on daily basis plz chk the counter items quality. dont sell expiry product please.
45,Coimbatore,Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar,very very host service
46,Coimbatore,Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar,I ordered 4 idlis and paid 180 rs for it . When I opened the pack I found only 2:idlis. This is real cheating biz. Get lost with ur service
47,Coimbatore,Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar,"Great service and excellent food.
We tried the special breakfast - it was very good and had many options. The ghee roast dosa with the three types of chutneys and sambar was delicious. The wadas also also well made and crunchy. I am also a fan of the sevige with the coconut chutney."
48,Coimbatore,Sri Krishnaa Tiffin Room,Too much costly... Dosaa are not cooked well and one day very salty... Too much cost and no quality equal to that... Only coz of hype...
49,Coimbatore,Sri Krishnaa Tiffin Room,"Sorry to say this Team Krishna Tiffin room, we were disappointed today with the quality of items served today. The items served were not hot at all (Kothu parotta, sweet ragi puttu, vadai). The quality and taste of Kothu parotta and badam milk was not good. Sweet puttu had too much jaggery in it. Vadai was too oily. Another food safety issue, is that the sambar and chutneys kept on the tables for self service, were not covered. Plus sambar has to be served hot everytime, based on customer's need. Cold foods are spoiling the dine in experience. Hope you take care of these in future."
50,Coimbatore,Sri Krishnaa Tiffin Room,Wasted food ... Packing to worst
51,Coimbatore,Café CakeBee,"Terrible service, no waiters around, they all go into the kitchen and you have to wait till they decide to come out. Almost everything on the menu was unavailable. We ordered orange juice, and mosambi juice came, and they didnt have ice. We ordered a grill chicken and mashed potatoes, they didn't have potatoes. All the food tasted homemade and underseasoned and below average quality. There were mosquitoes everywhere and the dinner was simply unbearable. Waste of money, waste of time, and not to mention- overcharged. For this 3/10 meal, we paid 1600."
52,Coimbatore,Café CakeBee,"The person in charge was extremely rude, and when I asked for a menu, he outright refused to provide one. I understand that the café is in the process of relocating, but that doesnt justify treating customers in such a manner."
53,Coimbatore,Café CakeBee,"I faced a terrible experience here. I have been here multiple times and honestly love the food, however the server (Ravi) /person in charge who is usually rude but was exceptionally ultra rude to us today. He in fact told us he will cancel our order and we can leave. And pointed at the google reviews poster to leave a complaint if we wanted to express our disappointment. We were so excited for our brunch today and he completely ruined our experience and quite honestly our morning. And I can assure we didnt raise our voice and spoke politely to him. Our reason to get such bad behaviour was because we requested if we could get half margherita pizza and half fungi pizza and replace the...read more"
54,Coimbatore,Café CakeBee,Hire more staff . The waiting time is abnormally high . The owner needs to do the groundwork . By far the best cafe in Coimbatore with the worst waiting time . Your sales will increase if waiting time is standard . Pls checkout truffles in Bangalore .
55,Coimbatore,Café CakeBee,"Quiet and relaxing ambience. Loved the food, and the quantity was perfect. Chicken parmigiana is a must try. Looking forward to try the desserts the next time."
56,Coimbatore,Luna Rooftop and Lounge,"This place is a disaster now! It is not the same Luna which i visited 3 months back. The menú which was in online was not available. Only 30% of menu was there. They have that new limited menu. Rooftop is not available now. We need to take a closed lounge and there horrible loud music was played. We cant even communicate with our dear ones. Even though we asked to reduce the music volume and there were no other customers at that time but still they refused to do it. Horrible management. If Luna doesnt correct this, then it may loose all its old customers"
57,Coimbatore,Luna Rooftop and Lounge,"Loved it! The dal was so good do try their burnt garlic noodles !!
They specially arrange n cheese cake n small decor for my son's bday.
The service is amazinggg.

58,Coimbatore,Luna Rooftop and Lounge,It took them almost 1hr to bring a pizza. Food was not upto the mark and hype
59,Coimbatore,Luna Rooftop and Lounge,"Food was great, but the cherry on top was the service by Mr.Sathya and Mr.Gunasekaran. Would love u to visit again and again for the great service and food. Kudos Luna team??"
60,Coimbatore,Luna Rooftop and Lounge,"I loved the service from RAJASEKARAN and SHARDENDHU
and the food was too good especially the pannaiyar parota and pattaya prawn was too good"
61,Coimbatore,Sherlock's - Lounge & Kitchen,Its a scam forced to pay entry charge for stag its covered but still didnt allow me to pay on Zomato drinks here are totally scam only ice cubes I really wonder how people put 5 star ratings when they have so many good restaurants or resto bars
62,Coimbatore,Sherlock's - Lounge & Kitchen,Drinks are a scam! It is not worthy! Its full water and ice cubes. 6 drinks down still not feel like drank alcohol. Shots are water
63,Coimbatore,Sherlock's - Lounge & Kitchen,"Would suggest not to go here , they just extort money .
when i went they told there is a offer if 2 plus one beer but when i saw there bill i realised that the beer which costs 260 bucks they charged 750 rs for it !!
So for me i would say its a waste of time to go their ..
their just in the extortion business!
#honestopinion"
64,Coimbatore,Sherlock's - Lounge & Kitchen,"Rude bunch of people...zero hospitality. Needs proper training. And the guy at the cash counter I am assuming to be the manager has a sour puss face and is very impolite... somebody remind him he's not the owner and just a bloody employee... I am making sure anybody I know who actually goes to bars to spend good money for fun and not to munch some cheap starters with cheap beer because they can't do that at home doesn't go to this awful bar!!!

By the way, the food is awful too!!!

And yes, let me not get started on the god awful music that doesn't let anyone have a good chat over a beer, nor allow them have a dance!!!! Change the sadist manager please!"
65,Coimbatore,Sherlock's - Lounge & Kitchen,Have visited Sherlock's in Bangalore couple of times. So didn't hesitate to get inside. Ordered few starters and Pasta and drinks. Staffs were good and overall ot was nice experience.
66,Coimbatore,The Bermuda,Good experience. Friendly staff.
67,Coimbatore,The Bermuda,We visited Bermuda on a Friday and the staff were very welcoming and suggested the best cocktails and dishes to go for. It was a pleasure being there. Francis Sam served us with a smile on his face. Would definitely recommend their long cocktails and gin triangle.
68,Coimbatore,The Bermuda,Nice service and food
69,Coimbatore,The Bermuda,"good food .. good service .. even the chef came to know the specifics we needed and gave his recommendation
