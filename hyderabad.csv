"2","Hyderabad","Okra - Hyderabad Marriott Hotel & Convention Centre","service very slow.. desserts are placed very far away , more number of desserts than starters"
"3","Hyderabad","Okra - Hyderabad Marriott Hotel & Convention Centre","Extremely sad to have visited this place. Very bad food quality, taste and service. Rather I would say pathetic SERVICE. Do not visit here if you think its a 5 star hotel and hygiene will be good. I have been to various not so 5 star plxes to eat and trust me they are atleast 10 times better."
"4","Hyderabad","Okra - Hyderabad Marriott Hotel & Convention Centre","I made a reservation 24 hours in advance and travelled 25 kms with my family to celebrate my brother's birthday.Despite showing the booking id we were said no table was available and no waiting time can guarantee the same.Never seen such clueless staff and I'll managed restaurant ton a 5 star. This should definitely be avoided -courtesy of the incompetent staff.

"6","Hyderabad","Okra - Hyderabad Marriott Hotel & Convention Centre","I recently indulged in the Sunday brunch at Okra, Marriott Hyderabad, and it was an overall delightful experience with a few minor areas for improvement.

Food
The food spread was impressive, offering a fine selection of cuisines to suit various palates. From Indian classics to international favorites, the options were satisfying. However, the real stars of the brunch were the desserts. The cheesecake, in particular, was exceptional—rich, creamy, and perfectly balanced. It’s a dessert lover’s dream and truly a highlight of the meal.

Service
The service during the brunch was above average but not quite up to the mark of excellence. While the staff was courteous and responsive, a bit...read more"
"7","Hyderabad","RAEN - The Leela","Raen – The Chef’s Studio had a warm, welcoming vibe, with a special chef-curated setup. We went there especially because Chef Vijaya Raghavan had introduced the Pandya Virundhu menu for a limited time. It was a 5-course Madurai-style feast, and every dish kept raising the bar for the one that followed.
The dessert, without doubt, was the showstopper – the best of them all.
Service by Vamshi was excellent. Highly recommend, and we’ll definitely be back at Raen soon."
"8","Hyderabad","RAEN - The Leela","My husband, sister in law and I had visited Raen the first time during a Assamese fest. We took a set menu to taste the food and we repeated almost all dishes at least once if not twice. Today we got my father in law and mother in law for the Bengali cuisine and it was so disappointing.Excw0t for the sorbet, chana er paturi and chingri & bhetki kabiraji, none of dishes were good. The service was very poor and I regret bringing my folks here. Not worth it."

Only Paneer tikka and cigar rolls were good"
"17","Hyderabad","Butterfly High","Fun place for dinner with a unique menu that blends local and global flavors in interesting ways.

The ambience was lively and welcoming, and the cocktails were very well mixed.

It’s definitely the kind of spot where you’re better off exploring the menu yourself to find the creative dishes rather than relying on standard recommendations ( our waiter recommended the basic stuff ) A great choice if you’re looking for something a little fun and different!"

Chicken 65 - it was too spicy for me to enjoy.
Mutton pudina sheekh - this was also too spicy. Couldn't finish even one sheekh piece.
Amritsari Chicken fingers - this was good. The fish was juicy on the inside and it had just the right amount of batter.
Mumbai masala papad - my vegetarian friend enjoyed it
Subz miljuli - this was good.
Jolly ki roti - these came fluffy and hot. My friends wanted them kadak and they were brought back kadak.

"29","Hyderabad","Medley","Firstly, it had limited space for parking, and it can be a big issue when.you trying to find a spot on a busy weekend. There was no one to escort us to an available space steep up inside the massive gate.

Although the ambience was good, but quantity of food was quite less when compared to the prices. We had ordered some chatpata chowmein noodles, burnt garlic fried rice, paneer lababdar, veg jalfrezi, tandoori rotis and some cream of almond and brocolli soup. The noodles and rice were excellent especiallly the noodles was very flavourful. But apart from it other items weren't so great. The less quantity for curries made it even more disappointing.

Thirdly, there were no designated...read more"

"39","Hyderabad","Kadali Kitchen","Our First Bite as Food Reviewers ? | Kadali, Jubilee Hills

This marks our first official review as we begin our food-loving journey on Zomato! Since we eat out a lot, we thought—why not share our experiences and help fellow foodies find the good stuff (and dodge the not-so-great)? So here goes!

We visited Kadali in Jubilee Hills, and let’s just say—it set the bar high!

We kicked off with the mutton paya soup—spicy, rich, and absolutely soul-warming. The kind of dish that makes you pause, smile, and go “Yup, this is gonna be a good meal.”

Next up: Appam with guthi vankaya curry. The appam? Light, fluffy, melt-in-the-mouth magic (though slightly sweet for our taste). The...read more"
"40","Hyderabad","Kadali Kitchen","Visited this place for lunch yesterday, Overall food was not bad however, Palak paneer was exceptionally bad. Raw Palak taste with no salt and flavour. When notified the same to the 1st floor manager he said it is supposed to be that way and argued with us, we asked him to taste it after tasting he said all I can do is add salt. Usually we would let things go but they way he spoke to us made us send the the dish back. This happened after we had to weight 30min for our main course.

One of the waiter when asked told us that the 10% service charge they add to the bill is not given to them so please be mindful while paying, ask them to remove the service charge from the bill and pay the...read more"

The staff was good too, may be due to holi there was less rush and we had peaceful time."

There was no variety on the menu, and the food we did get was extremely disappointing. To make matters worse, I’ve been sick and vomiting all morning — clearly something wasn’t right with what was served. I would not recommend this place to anyone."

Even though it was a buffet, Pintu went above and beyond to ensure we were well taken care of. He was incredibly attentive, promptly serving food and bringing dishes to our table with a warm and genuine smile. His proactive approach made the dining experience feel personalized and effortless.

While the buffet offered a good selection of dishes, the standout for me was the freshness and deliciousness of the fruits. They were a perfect and refreshing end to the meal.

However, it was Pintu's remarkable service that truly elevated our experience. His dedication and attentiveness are...read more"
"55","Hyderabad","Lé Vantage Cafe Bar","Visited this place recently. The ambience is good and has a nice vibe, but I was quite surprised by the limited menu options. For a group of five, the bill came to nearly ?9,000, which felt highly overpriced considering the food taste was below average for the rates charged. Honestly, the overall experience didn’t justify the cost."
"56","Hyderabad","Lé Vantage Cafe Bar","Valet person handed over the keys saying that take your own car which was very insulting"
"57","Hyderabad","Lé Vantage Cafe Bar","Ambience is good, open air airing with lights and jazz music to enjoy evening with. Food options are also good. It’s pet friendly, people not comfortable with pets should be prepared.
We tried mushroom capicujo, veg grilled sandwich, hibiscus tea, spinach rolls, and quesadillas. Almost everything we liked."
"58","Hyderabad","Lé Vantage Cafe Bar","Le Vantage used to be our favorite pub as it is the only pet friendly pub nearby. We used to love everything about this place. But lately, the quality of service has deteriorated. We went to have dinner, the food and the ice tea was good. However this 1 star is because of the service. We asked them to pack banofee pie and look at how they packed the dessert in a burger box. When I arrived home (which is 15 kms away from Le vantage) see the condition in the pic below. This dessert cost Rs. 450+ with taxes, is this how you pack your take away food? Very very disheartening!! I hope the owner checks this out and does something to replace the incompetent staffs you have hired lately. Btw...read more"

"65","Hyderabad","Kavyam The Telugu Table","Kavyam where bad food combines with super bad customer service... when complained to the waiter that the pulao has no salt the reply was to add as much salt as I want from the salt box on the table !! slow claps for a such a service.. another waiter just leaves a super hot ghee bowl on the table without informing it's hot resulting in fingers being burnt... the apricot delight was more of milk on apricot it was seriously not delightful.. absolutely horrifying experience.."
"66","Hyderabad","Kavyam The Telugu Table","I'm a regular at Kavyam and have always loved the food, which is why I brought my colleagues along recently, hoping they'd enjoy it too. Unfortunately, the food didn’t taste as good as usual, and to make things worse, several of us ended up feeling sick afterward—including me. It seems likely the issue came from the mushroom pakoda, especially since even one of our vegetarian teammates had to see a doctor. Just wanted to let you know so you can check on the food quality and hopefully prevent this from happening again."

"68","Hyderabad","Kavyam The Telugu Table","Food is absolutely good and flavourful but servicing needs to be improved. Some of the staff there were a bit rude and doesn’t respond properly .

Other than this the food and ambience is pretty good"

"70","Hyderabad","Kavyam The Telugu Table","ordered kodi rasam, nallakaram kodi and gun powder prawns to start with, first 2 were really good. the main course was a big dissappointment - ullikaram.kodi pulao was like mixing home chutney in rice and eating. and the kavyam table special biryani was not at all like a biryani. the gravy was not at all there and it felt like we are eating plain rice."
"71","Hyderabad","MOAI","While the ambience and theme is absolutely amazing, most items on the menu are NONSENSICALLY priced. High prices can still be acceptable if quantity is reasonable, but the starters can appetize max 2 people and the cocktails are filled with just ice."
"72","Hyderabad","MOAI","Go once to see the decor. Food is not worth the hype. We couldn't eat most of what we ordered. Either tasteless or over spiced. Staff are very confused and prefer to spend time talking to each other."
"73","Hyderabad","MOAI","Food is really tasty. Ranjan gave really good recommendations and great service. Would recommend."
"74","Hyderabad","MOAI","Black rice bhel was not so great but love silken tofu curry and hibachi fried rice, not to forget avocado gelato"
"75","Hyderabad","MOAI","We had an office party here and overall the experience was okay, especially the starters. The presentation was impressive and flavours are excellent. A special shout-out to Santu, who served us very well.

I am not giving 5 stars becuase the desserts were a major letdown. We tried all the desserts on the menu and for the price, they fell far short both in taste and value. When we shared the feedback asking to improve the dessert menu, the response from manager prayag is rude. He asked us if we are expecting a dark brownie from this restaurant. It is unhelpful and dismissive. Please train your managers properly so we can have a peaceful meal."

"77","Hyderabad","Tre-Forni Restaurant And Bar - Park Hyatt","The lady at the front desk of the restaurant was extremely rude and had no manners. Despite confirming our table reservation, she turned us down and we had to speak to the manager to get a table.

She didn’t even have the decency to apologize or try to have a conversation afterward. It was an unexpected incident at a Hyatt restaurant."
