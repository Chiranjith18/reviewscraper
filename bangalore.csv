"1","Bangalore","Homiga","We loved the barbecue at Homiga and Ujjal was fantastic with his service!"
"2","Bangalore","Homiga","Ujjal was a good host , the food and drinks were amazing"
"3","Bangalore","Homiga","I went with my brother to experience Korean BBQ that kdrama fans watch onscreen. It was a unique experience. The staff is super friendly and helpful, especially our server Ujjal guided us politely."
"4","Bangalore","Homiga","This was my second time here. compared to my first time I could see that the portion sizes had been considerably reduced (to almost half). It was quite sad to see that."
"5","Bangalore","Homiga","Went with high expectations because of the live barbecue but was highly disappointed. The food was basically flavourless. There are much better Korean places in Bangalore and one would expect a nice and competitive taste. But it was bad. Did not like a single dish. The ambience is okay but that’s about it."
"6","Bangalore","Maya","They told us that an item is unavailable 20 minutes after ordering. Most of the items were not available and what was told as available and would not take time took 30-40 minutes to come after repeated follow ups. We finally came back hungry after cancelling the order. If you want worst service and come back hungry please visit this place. Definitely not kid friendly either if your kid has to wait long for food or even worse come back hungry"
"7","Bangalore","Maya","Very disappointed with my experience. The food quality was extremely poor — the pizza was served uncooked, and when I pointed it out, the staff were completely unbothered and rude. Service was slow and unprofessional throughout. Definitely not worth the money or time. Food is very bad"
"8","Bangalore","Maya","Not even kidding, actually I am surprised how this place is 4.4- the staff is lazy, food is not at all good. It says if you do booking, you get complimentary dessert. Staff is too rude, if you tell them this dish is not prepared well, they will say this is how it is prepared. Pls don’t visit."
"9","Bangalore","Maya","Kaini was very courteous in taking up the order and delivering the food scrumptious"
"10","Bangalore","Maya","Asian tempura and the ravioli were delicious. Really nice ambiance. Would visit again"
"11","Bangalore","Sozo Skyline","The caller you picked my phone did not respond and the stewardship is poor."
"12","Bangalore","Sozo Skyline","The view is great and so is the food! Great place for a nice cozy quiet dinner"
"13","Bangalore","Sozo Skyline","Had a wonderful experience at Sozo! From the ambience to the service, everything was spot on. Special thanks to Luna & Masai, who made the experience even better with her warm and attentive service. The food was absolutely delicious – full of flavor and beautifully presented. The vibe of the place is great, perfect for both casual outings and special occasions. Definitely worth visiting again!"
"14","Bangalore","Sozo Skyline","Good service by hamkha..very good atmosphere..highly recommended"
"15","Bangalore","Sozo Skyline","great ambience but not a fan of the food it was worst the chicken was stinking it had very bad smell also the food was not tasty at all"
"16","Bangalore","Maddy's Resto Pub","Bartender was really nice on requesting him for a cocktail out of the menu"
"17","Bangalore","Maddy's Resto Pub","Came here on date and had a fantastic time

Got a discount of 50% through Zomato"
"18","Bangalore","Maddy's Resto Pub","Pool table is fun

"19","Bangalore","Maddy's Resto Pub","Come to Maddys if u don’t like the cheap crowd of other pubs in the area
Good ambience and picturesque interiors with good music"
"20","Bangalore","Maddy's Resto Pub","update menu what is actual"
"21","Bangalore","KoMaama","Food is good hence the 3 stars. service however sucks. staff (and managers) didn't even try to check if our requests could be accommodated and were curt about it. doubt we'll be going there again."
"22","Bangalore","KoMaama","While the food is fine the staff was not at all helpful with a payment glitch and resulted in ?500 loss for the customer. Would not return"
"23","Bangalore","KoMaama","If you're looking for a korean restaurant you need to check out this place. ""The food is really outstanding! every food we had was full of flavour and cooked to perfection.where their kind and friendly staff came in .
Thank to sofi and the whole crew for hosting us for an experience."
"24","Bangalore","KoMaama","I received the order after 35 mins of ordering .Ordered the sushi platter .Tuna was tasting bitter .Prawns was rubbery and rice just didn’t seem good .For me it was a below average food experience ."
"25","Bangalore","KoMaama","good taste and fresh food available."
"26","Bangalore","Rox","Good food, good place"
"27","Bangalore","Rox","Expensive place low class cocktail left with hangover they use cheap alcohol. Food was OK"
"28","Bangalore","Rox","We went out for a casual mid week dinner and this place was the best choice we made. Loved the ambience. Music was too good, with a mix of English and regional language songs. The vibe was the best! We ordered a #mocktail and some #vegfood and it was pretty good. felt the price was high but thanks to the offer on zomato it wasn't too much. food menu is a bit unique and even the taste was good. quantity is less but it's absolutely fine. overall a very nice dining experience. as it was Tuesday we expected less to no crowd but we were surprised to see that the restaurant was full!!"
"29","Bangalore","Rox","today I went with family my 2 kids and my wife .it was horrible staff is so unprofessional really I doubt the reviews now and star rating.my Initailly I ordered a desert for my kid as he was very hungry they didn't bring only that item and that's so sad because they don't even feel sorry about it.i really feel the rating has to be checked becoz doesn't seems to be genuine"

"33","Bangalore","Jollygunj","Thank you Vishnu for excellent service...loved it here and must visit"
"34","Bangalore","Jollygunj","The food portions looks like a tasting menu barely enough for one person , hope they improve the portion quantity for better dining experience"
"35","Bangalore","Jollygunj","Had a great time with my friends at Diwali party in Jollygunj.. food reminds me of good old calcutta days.. staff is congenial too.. place is huge… interiors are like old colonial calcutta"
"36","Bangalore","Go Native","Vivek and jotish Neeraj excellent food excellent service"
"37","Bangalore","Go Native","Please do yourself a favor and give this place a pass. Poor service, bad food. Don’t know what the high rating is about."
"38","Bangalore","Go Native","One of the best jain preparation (masala cheese poori ), I had in bangalore."
"39","Bangalore","Go Native","outstanding food and service"
"40","Bangalore","Go Native","The ambience is undoubtedly very good, but the staff struggles to manage the crowd. Even with a reservation, you’ll end up waiting at least 30 minutes. The starters are nice, but the main course is quite disappointing. Overall, this place seems suitable only if you want to have some quick snacks—not ideal for lunch, dinner, or special occasions. This was my first time and I guess last too. I would not prefer going to this place again."

"50","Bangalore","Kling Brewery","beautiful place. food was delicious.
service was excellent.
thank you Kivibo ."
"51","Bangalore","Kling Brewery","Walked into this place on a rainy Saturday evening. Luckily got an easy entry. The place is laid out in three major sections, European styled Deck on the entrance, followed by an indoor sitting area with a nice big screen and out door smoking areas on both the flank.

The Beer was nice to which I ordered Victoria Wee Heavy and Heff Brigade... I liked both the Beers. Food was nice, Chicken Nachos was nice however the quantity was less. Tawa Chicken was very nice and well flavoured. Chicken Caesar was dressed with just the right amount of seasonings and sauces. A big Shout out to Mr Gajraj who served us and he really took care if us and made recommendations which helped us order...read more"
"52","Bangalore","Kling Brewery","Good food, great ambience, great service by Dinesh"
"53","Bangalore","Kling Brewery","Good place to chill with friends. Cocktails and food are good."
"54","Bangalore","Kling Brewery","The chicken dumpling was stale. Stomach is so messed up. Had to take off from work.
And the mistakenly served prawn was a disastrous recipe.
Most probably it was the chicken dumpling.
Eating outside is risky and this place confirmed it."
"55","Bangalore","Stories 2.0","Good food and organised place for small get together or parties. Excellent service too. We had a great dining experience, thanks to Mr Peter .."
"56","Bangalore","Stories 2.0","Naresh he’s provided a good service"
"57","Bangalore","Stories 2.0","Rakesh Kumar manager does not have manners to talk. The staff threatened ME THAT the property belongs to MLA"
"58","Bangalore","Stories 2.0","Average food, limited menu for food combinations. Staff service is lousy, you remind for cutlery, tumblers, water -the basics. Service can be widely improved.
Ambience is too dark, instead of warm relaxed dinner setup, it becomes gloomy."
"59","Bangalore","Stories 2.0","Abhijit Dev Choudhury"
"60","Bangalore","Stories 2.0","Sibaprasad Jena was great at service. At his toes always to provide a delightful experience. The food was equally tasty."
"61","Bangalore","Jamming Goat 3.0","awesome place. food drinks,.service everything was too notch"
"62","Bangalore","Jamming Goat 3.0","Everything was perfect here
The cocktail,the music ,the service and ofcourse the vibe just osmm
10/10 by my side ?"
"63","Bangalore","Jamming Goat 3.0","I was really excited to visit this place but i was so sad when I got to know they are probably gonna shut it down soon? So they only had one floor operational and that too coz the place was booked for a private event. Well atleast i got to visit before that. The drinks are really good here but again they did not have a lot of options in food and drinks available as they have started closing it down. The food was nice, presentation outstanding. Loved the stuffed kulcha here the most. Would have probably given a higher rating if it was more open and available!"
"64","Bangalore","Jamming Goat 3.0","Amazing ambience with great music and a menu that never disappoints! ? The service was quick, the presentation was impressive, and everything tasted fresh and flavorful. Perfect for both casual dinners and weekend outings"

"71","Bangalore","Street Storyss","nice place and nice food"
"72","Bangalore","Street Storyss","I visited Secret Storys (Rex Mall, Brigade Road) today for lunch with my family. We had booked a table for 2 PM through Zomato (prepaid reservation). We reached on time and informed the staff, but were asked to wait for 10 minutes. Even after repeated follow-ups, we were only given a table around 2:30–2:35 PM. Since we had already paid, cancellation was not an option, and this delay became inconvenient as we had to head to another location soon.

The restaurant is quite small and compact, with about 14 tables, and there was a large crowd waiting outside—an elderly couple, a pregnant lady, and many others. If the restaurant cannot accommodate so many guests at once, it would be better...read more"
